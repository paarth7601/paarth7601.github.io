    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p class="job-title">Research Associate <span class="date">(February 2025 - Current)</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked on making battery digital twins more adaptable to novel conditions not seen during data collection.</li>
      <li>Our model could predict the temperature with an error below the sensor error of 1K.</li>
      <li>Our model could predict voltage with 87.13% of predictions with MAPE less than 1% and 99.68% with MAPE less than 5%.</li>
      <li>Our model required a median of 1 and an average of 1.7 model updates to keep voltage MAPE below 1% along with temperature error < 1K.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="job-title">Project Assistant <span class="date">(September 2024 - December 2024)</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked on making battery swapping fast, low-cost, and trustworthy by improving capacity prediction accuracy.</li>
      <li>Fast Capacity prediction algorithm gives <0.5% MAPE using only 2 seconds of electro-thermal data.</li>
      <li>Used a lightweight gradient boosting ML algorithm for real-world feasibility.</li>
    </ul>
